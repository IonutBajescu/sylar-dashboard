Sylar's Dashboard
=================

Provides an interface so you can easily visualise the latest attempted intrusions on your website. While not that common for open source projects, having an IDS installed without a dashboard it's like installing Gecko without Firefox. You might be able to use the functionality but you'll never be able to make use of its entire power.
